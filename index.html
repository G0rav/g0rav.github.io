                    <p><br>


                        In this research paper, I introduced a convolutional neural network model named Flynet to
                        address the
                        challenge of automatic building detection in high-resolution satellite images. Existing methods
                        often suffer
                        from time-consuming processes and incomplete solutions due to the complexity of visual features
                        and the
                        presence of other objects in the images. Flynet is designed with an encoder-decoder
                        architecture,
                        incorporating improvements that enhance its speed, lightweight nature, and accuracy.<br><br>

                        The experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms U-Net, providing <strong>more
                            accurate</strong>
                        predictions while
                        being <strong>three times faster</strong> and <strong>70% smaller in size.</strong> Through this
                        research
                        paper, my aim was not only to
                        contribute to the development of state-of-the-art algorithms for satellite image analysis but
                        also to open new
                        possibilities for real-world applications in remote sensing, urban planning, and disaster
                        management.</p><br>

                        detail, and very tiny face, making it more challenging for a face detection algorithm to
                        accurately identify
                        faces amidst the abundance of visual information.<br><br>

                        <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                        To address the challenges of developing a high-resolution face detection algorithm in
                        tensorflow, I undertook
                        a
                        comprehensive approach.<br>

                        Dataset Preparation:
                        To prepare the dataset for training, I prepared few python scripts. I first divided each
                        high-resolution image
                        into 16 parts, ensuring overlapping sections to cover every possible face. I then applied an
                        open-source face
                        detection model to these image segments. This process resulted in a well-annotated and diverse
                        dataset,
                        crucial
                        for training a robust model.<br>

                        Model Architecture: Afterward, I crafted the model architecture from scratch and embarked on
                        training the
                        model
                        using the dataset. This custom architecture allowed for fine-tuning the algorithm to perform
                        optimally on
                        high-resolution images with tiny faces, a challenging task in itself.<br>

                        Inferencing Optimization: I also optimized the inferencing process by dividing the input image
                        into 4 parts,
                        ensuring efficient and accurate detection of faces during application usage.<br>

                        The combination of these steps resulted in an exceptional high-resolution face detection
                        algorithm, which not
                        only achieved an accuracy rate of over 99% but also significantly improved the overall speed and
                        accuracy of
                        face detection in real-world scenarios.<br><br>


                        <strong>Impact:</strong><br>
                        This project led to a rapid growth in the company, as we received significantly fewer complaints
                        about face
                        detection. Furthermore, people began recommending the product to others due to the enhanced
                        accuracy and
                        reliability of the face detection algorithm.<br>

                <h3>Faster yet accurate kiss classification</h3>

                <div class="project-details">
                    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong><br>
                        Task aimed to classify images into three categories: 'kiss,' 'almost kiss,' and 'no kiss.' The
                        primary
                        challenge
                        faced was the high resolution of the images, with an average resolution of around 6k pixels.
                        This high
                        resolution made it challenging for machine learning models to achieve accurate results,
                        particularly as the
                        kiss
                        event typically occurred in a very small region of the entire image. The initial model had an
                        accuracy of only
                        24%, which was lower than what a random model could provide (33% in this case).<br><br>

                        <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                        To address these challenges, I adopted a multi-step approach. Firstly, I leveraged a face
                        detection model's
                        predictions to identify the region of interest within the image. Next, I implemented a smart
                        cropping
                        algorithm
                        to extract and prepare the input for my machine learning model. Subsequently, I trained a
                        Convolutional Neural
                        Network (CNN) on these cropped images.

                        One additional challenge I encountered was the class imbalance in the dataset. I had a limited
                        number of kiss
                        images (15k) compared to a much larger number of images for the 'almost kiss' and 'no kiss'
                        classes
                        (approximately 100k each). To mitigate this imbalance, I employed weighted loss functions and
                        down-sampled the
                        dataset.<br><br>


                        <strong>Impact:</strong> <br>Approach yielded significant improvements. The model's accuracy
                        increased to
                        approximately 80%,
                        representing a substantial enhancement over the initial 24% accuracy. Additionally, the
                        preprocessing step
                        significantly improved inference speed. As a result, the overall speed of the application
                        increased by 10%,
                        leading to heightened customer satisfaction.<br>

                <h3>Image Composition Assessment with YOLO</h3>

                <div class="project-details">
                    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong><br>
                        The project's primary goal was to assess the composition quality of an image, specifically in
                        terms of
                        adhering
                        to the rule of thirds and accurately identifying the subject's position within the
                        image.<br><br>

                        <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                        To address this challenge, I employed the YOLO machine learning model to detect and locate the
                        subjects within
                        the images. YOLO is known for its real-time object detection capabilities, making it suitable
                        for identifying
                        the subjects swiftly and accurately.

                        Subsequently, I developed an algorithm that assigned a composition score to each image based on
                        two key
                        factors:
                        the subject's position within the image and adherence to the rule of thirds. This algorithm
                        considered the
                        subject's placement in relation to the rule of thirds grid and evaluated how well the image
                        composition
                        aligned
                        with this fundamental principle of visual design.<br><br>


                        <strong>Impact:</strong><br>
                        The implemented solution demonstrated remarkable performance in assessing image composition. By
                        efficiently
                        detecting subjects and evaluating composition quality, it provided valuable insights for

                <h3>Correct White Balance Prediction in Image</h3>

                <div class="project-details">
                    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong><br>
                        The project's primary challenge was to correct the white balance of an image by accurately
                        predicting the
                        appropriate temperature and tint values for editing in Adobe Lightroom. Adobe Lightroom offers a
                        wide range of
                        white balance temperature options, from 2000K to 50,000K Kelvin, allowing photographers to
                        adjust them based
                        on
                        their preferences. Predicting the correct values within this extensive range can be a daunting
                        task.<br><br>

                        <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                        To address this challenge, I conducted a detailed analysis of the impact of temperature values
                        on images.
                        Through this analysis, I observed that changes in temperature values beyond 9,000K and below
                        2,400K had
                        minimal
                        impact on the image. Therefore, I focused on developing a regression-based machine learning
                        model within this
                        temperature range.

                        The model's objective was to predict the ideal temperature and tint values for white balance
                        correction,
                        simplifying the editing process in Adobe Lightroom. In this case, I employed transfer learning
                        and designed a
                        CNN architecture that not only takes images but also the current Temp and Tint values into
                        account. I then
                        trained the model using the prepared dataset.<br><br>


                        <strong>Impact:</strong><br>
                        The implementation of this machine learning solution had a significant impact on image editing
                        efficiency. By
                        predicting temperature and tint values within a practical range, it streamlined the white
                        balance correction
                        process for photographers, saving them time and improving the overall quality of image
                        editing.<br>

                        The challenge was to categorize products into 10,000 different categories based on their product
                        title and the
                        description. The dataset posed a significant challenge due to its vast size, comprising 3
                        million data
                        points.<br><br>

                        <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                        Given the immense dataset, my approach began with a thorough data analysis and data cleaning to
                        gain a
                        comprehensive understanding. I identified the primary challenge as data imbalance, with over
                        ~95% of the data
                        points belonging to approximately 2,700 categories, leaving the remaining 5% distributed across
                        roughly 7,300
                        categories.<br>

                        To address this challenge, I used a two-fold solution. First, I trained a machine learning model
                        using
                        Tensorflow/Keras on the 95% of the dataset that belonged to the 2,700 classes. I experimented
                        with various
                        Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, starting with simple techniques like Bag of Words,
                        TF-IDF, and
                        Word2Vec, leveraging the Python's NLTK library for data preparation. For the remaining 5% of the
                        dataset,
                        encompassing approximately 7,300 classes, I implemented a straightforward random model that
                        provided random
                        predictions for these categories.<br>

                        Attached graph shows the cumulative distribution of the target classes.<br><br>


                        <strong>Impact:</strong><br>
                        While I was unable to submit my solution within the deadline, my approach demonstrated
                        remarkable results.
                        Even
                        with the simplicity of using clever data preparation and a basic Bag of Words model, the
                        accuracy achieved was
                        on par with the best solutions at the time that utilized advanced models like BERT. This project

                        To achieve this, the initial challenge was to create a dataset because there wasn't a readily
                        available one. I
                        talked to developers from different departments to figure out if the number of files affected
                        build time and
                        which changes took more or less time. Afterward, I conducted data analysis and feature
                        engineering using
                        Python
                        libraries like pandas and matplotlib to prepare the necessary features. I trained several
                        regression machine
                        learning models and found that the decision tree performed the best. The great thing about it
                        was that it not
                        only predicted the build time but also provided information about the importance of each
                        feature.<br><br>


                        <strong>Impact:</strong><br>
                        The deployment of the machine learning model delivered significant benefits. Developers now had
                        access to
                        precise predictions for ticket build times, leading to increased efficiency and better project
                        management.
                        This
                        project showcased my ability to leverage machine learning to optimize processes and enhance
                        productivity
                        within
                        the development team, ultimately contributing to more effective software development
                        practices.<br>

                <h3>Web Application for Automatic Background Removal in Images</h3>

                <div class="project-details">
                    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong><br>
                        The challenge at hand was to create a machine learning model capable of automatically removing
                        backgrounds
                        from
                        images. It involves distinguishing the main subject from the background, which can be complex
                        and vary
                        significantly across different images.<br><br>

                        <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                        To tackle this problem, I leveraged a diverse dataset of images containing various subjects and
                        backgrounds.
                        The
                        objective was to develop an efficient model that could accurately identify and isolate the main
                        subject from
                        the
                        background.<br>

                        Initially, I explored the use of existing deep learning models, such as Mask R-CNN and U-Net,
                        known for their
                        segmentation capabilities. However, these models often came with computational overhead and
                        larger model
                        sizes.<br>

                        To optimize for speed and model size, I devised a custom CNN-based architecture, drawing
                        inspiration from
                        U-Net
                        but tailoring it to the specific task of background removal. The challenge lay in achieving
                        real-time or
                        near-real-time processing while preserving accuracy.<br><br>

                        Web Application Development:<br>
                        In addition to the model development, I also created a user-friendly web application using
                        Flask. This web app
                        allowed users to upload their images and receive instant background removal results. It provided
                        a seamless
                        and
                        intuitive interface for individuals and businesses to utilize this powerful image editing
                        capability without
                        the
                        need for extensive technical expertise.<br><br>

                        <strong>Impact:</strong><br>
                        The result of this project was a highly efficient model for automatic background removal in
                        images, coupled
                        with
                        a user-friendly web application. It offered real-time or near-real-time performance while
                        effectively removing
                        complex backgrounds.<br><br>
