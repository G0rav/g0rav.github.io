      <h3>Developed a High-Resolution Face Detection Algorithm (>99% accuracy)</h3>
      <p>

        Problem Statement:<br>
        The project involves the development of a face detection machine learning algorithm on high resolution images
        that achieved an impressive accuracy rate of over 99%. High-resolution images contain a substantial amount of
        detail, and very tiny face, making it more challenging for a face detection algorithm to accurately identify
        faces amidst the abundance of visual information.<br><br>

        Solution:<br>
        To address the challenges of developing a high-resolution face detection algorithm in tensorflow, I undertook a
        comprehensive approach.<br>

        Dataset Preparation:
        To prepare the dataset for training, I prepared few python scripts. I first divided each high-resolution image
        into 16 parts, ensuring overlapping sections to cover every possible face. I then applied an open-source face
        detection model to these image segments. This process resulted in a well-annotated and diverse dataset, crucial
        for training a robust model.<br>

        Model Architecture: Afterward, I crafted the model architecture from scratch and embarked on training the model
        using the dataset. This custom architecture allowed for fine-tuning the algorithm to perform optimally on
        high-resolution images with tiny faces, a challenging task in itself.<br>

        Inferencing Optimization: I also optimized the inferencing process by dividing the input image into 4 parts,
        ensuring efficient and accurate detection of faces during application usage.<br>

        The combination of these steps resulted in an exceptional high-resolution face detection algorithm, which not
        only achieved an accuracy rate of over 99% but also significantly improved the overall speed and accuracy of
        face detection in real-world scenarios.<br><br>


        Impact:<br>
        This project led to a rapid growth in the company, as we received significantly fewer complaints about face
        detection. Furthermore, people began recommending the product to others due to the enhanced accuracy and
        reliability of the face detection algorithm.<br>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Faster yet accurate kiss classification</h3>
      <p>Problem Statement:<br>
        Task aimed to classify images into three categories: 'kiss,' 'almost kiss,' and 'no kiss.' The primary challenge
        faced was the high resolution of the images, with an average resolution of around 6k pixels. This high
        resolution made it challenging for machine learning models to achieve accurate results, particularly as the kiss
        event typically occurred in a very small region of the entire image. The initial model had an accuracy of only
        24%, which was lower than what a random model could provide (33% in this case).<br><br>

        Solution:<br>
        To address these challenges, I adopted a multi-step approach. Firstly, I leveraged a face detection model's
        predictions to identify the region of interest within the image. Next, I implemented a smart cropping algorithm
        to extract and prepare the input for my machine learning model. Subsequently, I trained a Convolutional Neural
        Network (CNN) on these cropped images.

        One additional challenge I encountered was the class imbalance in the dataset. I had a limited number of kiss
        images (15k) compared to a much larger number of images for the 'almost kiss' and 'no kiss' classes
        (approximately 100k each). To mitigate this imbalance, I employed weighted loss functions and down-sampled the
        dataset.<br><br>


        Impact: <br>Approach yielded significant improvements. The model's accuracy increased to approximately 80%,
        representing a substantial enhancement over the initial 24% accuracy. Additionally, the preprocessing step
        significantly improved inference speed. As a result, the overall speed of the application increased by 10%,
        leading to heightened customer satisfaction.<br></p>

      <h3>Image Composition Assessment with YOLO</h3>
      <p>Problem Statement:<br>
        The project's primary goal was to assess the composition quality of an image, specifically in terms of adhering
        to the rule of thirds and accurately identifying the subject's position within the image.<br><br>

        Solution:<br>
        To address this challenge, I employed the YOLO machine learning model to detect and locate the subjects within
        the images. YOLO is known for its real-time object detection capabilities, making it suitable for identifying
        the subjects swiftly and accurately.

        Subsequently, I developed an algorithm that assigned a composition score to each image based on two key factors:
        the subject's position within the image and adherence to the rule of thirds. This algorithm considered the
        subject's placement in relation to the rule of thirds grid and evaluated how well the image composition aligned
        with this fundamental principle of visual design.<br><br>


        Impact:<br>
        The implemented solution demonstrated remarkable performance in assessing image composition. By efficiently
        detecting subjects and evaluating composition quality, it provided valuable insights for selecting the best
        images<br></p>

      <h3>Correct White Balance Prediction in Image</h3>
      <p>Problem Statement:<br>
        The project's primary challenge was to correct the white balance of an image by accurately predicting the
        appropriate temperature and tint values for editing in Adobe Lightroom. Adobe Lightroom offers a wide range of
        white balance temperature options, from 2000K to 50,000K Kelvin, allowing photographers to adjust them based on
        their preferences. Predicting the correct values within this extensive range can be a daunting task.<br><br>

        Solution:<br>
        To address this challenge, I conducted a detailed analysis of the impact of temperature values on images.
        Through this analysis, I observed that changes in temperature values beyond 9,000K and below 2,400K had minimal
        impact on the image. Therefore, I focused on developing a regression-based machine learning model within this
        temperature range.

        The model's objective was to predict the ideal temperature and tint values for white balance correction,
        simplifying the editing process in Adobe Lightroom. In this case, I employed transfer learning and designed a
        CNN architecture that not only takes images but also the current Temp and Tint values into account. I then
        trained the model using the prepared dataset.<br><br>


        Impact:<br>
        The implementation of this machine learning solution had a significant impact on image editing efficiency. By
        predicting temperature and tint values within a practical range, it streamlined the white balance correction
        process for photographers, saving them time and improving the overall quality of image editing.<br></p>
